# Reimagined World Menu

### Note: I pretty much had to throw out the original world menu, so mod compatibility with mods that also modify the world menu is and probably always will be non-existent

Completely Re-designs the Create World menu, as well as making some changes to the world list.

Features: Complete Create World menu overhaul.

    * Ability to add a custom icon for the world before creation.
    
    * Increased resolution for world icons.
    
    * Translations for Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, German and Serbian.

I'm entirely open to design changes and will consider adding your suggestion. I'm also open to adding and/or editing translations for your language, you will have two options:

    * Translate the text yourself
    
    * Or have me use Google Translate (Which is prone to inaccuracy, but can be quicker)
